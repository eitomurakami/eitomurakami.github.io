										<h1>Pigments Of Imagination (2023)</h1>
									</header>
									<p><b><i>Pigments of Imagination (2023) - Timothy Gmeiner & Eito Murakami</i></b> is an interactive virtual reality experience that frames the creative process as a narrative relating the synesthetic inner-workings of one’s unique imagination to the universe around us. It is an observation on the beauty, fear, adventure, sadness and loneliness of self-discovery and the artist’s ultimate recognition of process as goal, as told through the story of a small child’s journey to the moon. This installation is designed to re-imagine the popular music video in a virtual space as a dynamic, emotionally engaging experience by exploring distinctive relationships between spatialization, audiovisual reactivity and interactivity, which allow for a narrative immersion that maintains a structured arc and conclusion but unique experience with each use.

									<p><i>Pigments of Imagination (2021)</i> is a collaborative audiovisual project by Gabriel Zalles Ballivian, Tim Gmeiner, and Eito Murakami. The main element of the project is a popular music track touching on themes of imagination and space travel. The song is composed and produced by <a target="_blank" href="https://illpoetic.com/">Timothy “Ill Poetic” Gmeiner</a>, and features vocals by Ill Poetic and Nick Tolford, flugelhorn by renowned jazz artist <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stephrichards.com/music/">Stephanie Richards</a>, and additional synthesizer parts by DJ/Producer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kingbritt.com/">King Britt</a>.</p>
									<p>The A-frame project offers a dynamic virtual reality experience that accompanies the song. Several spheres were textured and set to rotate around the listener, serving the theme of outer space. A 360 degree photograph from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eso.org/public/images/archive/category/360pano/">the European Southern Observatory</a> was used to texture the sky element. Additionally, some GLTF objects collected from <a target="_blank" href="https://poly.google.com/">Google Poly</a> were imported into the scene.</p>
